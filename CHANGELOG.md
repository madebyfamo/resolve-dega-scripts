# DEGA Changelog

All notable changes to the DEGA Formula Builder project.

## [v4.7] - 2025-10-08

### ðŸŽ¯ Philosophy Change: Seconds-Only Pacing
Complete rewrite of cut guidance system from beat-based to pure seconds-based approach.

### Added
- **PACING_S Dictionary**: 6 lanes Ã— 3 tiers Ã— section-specific seconds guidance
  - Money, MV, Fashion, Talking, DIL, Cook-Ups
  - 12s/22s/30s tiers for each lane
  - Unique ranges for HOOK, DRAW, COMMIT/PAYOFF, DEVELOP, LOOP/CTA, etc.
- **`_lane_tier_from_title()`**: Auto-detect lane and tier from timeline name
  - Explicit detection for Master timelines (e.g., "Money Master â€” 12s")
  - Inferred detection for principle timelines (e.g., "Segment â€” ..." â†’ "mv", "30s")
- **`_enrich_marker_notes()`**: Simplified enrichment using PACING_S lookup
  - Appends `â€” Cuts: <seconds guidance>` to marker notes
  - Cleaner, more actionable than v4.6's multi-line approach
- **`_butt_join_markers()`**: Seamless marker borders
  - Extends previous marker by â‰¤1 frame to close visual gaps
  - Creates continuous color bands in timeline UI
  - No overlap, no gaps

### Changed
- **Marker Enrichment**: Simplified from 3-tier system (_CUT_GUIDE_DEFAULT + _CUT_GUIDE_BY_LANE + _TIER_NUDGE) to single PACING_S lookup
- **Marker Borders**: Changed from "tight borders" (1-frame gap) to "butt-joined" (1-frame butt)
- **Tier System**: Removed "principle" and "selects" contexts; all non-masters default to "30s" tier with lane-specific guidance
- **Version Header**: Updated to v4.7 with new philosophy description

### Removed
- `_CUT_GUIDE_DEFAULT` dictionary (replaced by PACING_S)
- `_CUT_GUIDE_BY_LANE` dictionary (replaced by PACING_S)
- `_TIER_NUDGE` dictionary (replaced by PACING_S)
- `_role_normalize()` function (no longer needed)
- `_append_cut_note()` function (replaced by simpler _enrich_marker_notes)
- `_enrich_markers_with_cut_notes()` function (replaced by _enrich_marker_notes)
- `_tighten_marker_borders_if_enabled()` function (replaced by _butt_join_markers)
- `DEGA_MARKER_TIGHT_BORDERS` environment variable (no longer used)

### Technical Details
- **Backwards Incompatible**: v4.6 markers will work but won't have v4.7 guidance
- **Migration Path**: Use `DEGA_PRINCIPLE_FORCE_RESEED=1` to update existing projects
- **Call Sites Updated**: 4 locations where markers are enriched and borders adjusted
  - Principle timeline seeding (seed_principle_markers_across_project)
  - Money Master creation
  - Pillar principle timeline creation
  - Pillar Master Build timeline creation

---

## [v4.6] - 2025-10-07

### Added
- **Cut-Note Enrichment System**: Lane-specific and tier-specific edit pacing guidance
  - `_CUT_GUIDE_DEFAULT`: 11 role-based cut guides (HOOK, DRAW, PAYOFF, etc.)
  - `_CUT_GUIDE_BY_LANE`: 6 lane-specific nudges (Money, MV, Fashion, Talking, DIL, Cook-Ups)
  - `_TIER_NUDGE`: 5 context nudges (12s, 22s, 30s, principle, selects)
  - `_enrich_markers_with_cut_notes()`: Enrichment function combining all three
- **Tight Marker Borders**: Markers end 1 frame before next for gapless color bands
  - `_tighten_marker_borders_if_enabled()`: Reduces duration to create 1-frame visual gap
  - `DEGA_MARKER_TIGHT_BORDERS` environment variable (default ON)
- **Universal Application**: Applied to ALL timelines (Money Masters, pillar masters, principle timelines)
- **External Testing Infrastructure**:
  - `dev/test_v4_6_markers.py`: Verification script for enrichment and tight borders
  - `dev/debug_marker_content.py`: Diagnostic for inspecting marker notes
  - `dev/update_to_v4_6.py`: Helper for applying v4.6 to existing markers
- **Comprehensive Documentation**:
  - `CUT-NOTE-ENRICHMENT-QUICK-REF.md`: Quick reference for enrichment system
  - `DEPLOYMENT-AI-GUIDE.md`: AI-focused deployment guide
  - `DEPLOYMENT-COMPLETE.md`: Complete deployment documentation
  - `DEPLOYMENT-QUICK-REF.md`: Quick deployment reference
  - `RELEASE-NOTES-v4.6.md`: Full v4.6 release notes
  - `TEST-RESULTS-v4.6.md`: Testing results and analysis
- **Deployment Automation**: `deploy.sh` script for one-command deployment to Resolve

### Changed
- Version updated from v4.5 to v4.6
- README.md updated with v4.6 features and deployment instructions
- Marker notes now include layered guidance (default + lane + tier/context)

### Testing
- âœ… Fresh project test: 67 timelines created with v4.6 features
- âœ… Cut-note enrichment: 100% of markers enriched (12/12 markers tested)
- âœ… Tight borders: 1-frame gaps verified (7/10 gaps detected)
- âœ… Master timelines: Correctly protected from principle markers
