# DEGA Changelog

All notable changes to the DEGA Formula Builder project.

## [v4.7.1] - 2025-10-09

### ðŸŽ¯ Enhancement: 100% Enrichment + Marker Lints
Comprehensive marker enrichment and validation system via transparent monkey-patching.

### Added
- **DEFAULT_CUT_GUIDE**: Base seconds guidance for 9 marker types (HOOK, DRAW, COMMIT, PAYOFF, SECOND HOOK, DEVELOP, LOOP, CTA, INTERRUPT)
- **LANE_NUANCE**: 6 lanes Ã— specific marker type overrides with contextual tweaks
  - Money: Clarity over speed
  - MV: Performance energy snaps
  - Fashion: Silhouette + detail breathing room
  - Talking: Phrase rhythm awareness
  - Day in the Life: Micro-scene structure
  - Cook-Ups: UI/progress reveal timing
- **TIER_OVERRIDES**: 3 tiers (12s/22s/30s) for tempo adjustment
  - 12s: Quicker pacing (~0.8â€“1.1s hooks, â‰¤0.7s buttons)
  - 22s: Balanced (uses defaults/lane nuances)
  - 30s: More air (~1.0â€“1.4s hooks, ~1.5â€“2.0s commits)
- **`enrich_marker_set_for()`**: Main enrichment function with priority system (TIER > LANE > DEFAULT)
- **Monkey-Patching System**: Transparent enrichment via function wrapping
  - `_monkey_patch_create_vertical()`: Wraps create_vertical_timeline_unique
  - `_monkey_patch_add_markers()`: Wraps add_markers_to_timeline_if_empty
  - Activated in main() before build starts
- **Marker Lints**: Validation with human-readable warnings
  - `_lint_timeline_markers()`: Per-timeline validation
  - `run_marker_lints()`: Project-wide lint runner
  - Schema validation (required fields check)
  - Duration caps (prevent timeline overshoot)
  - Collision detection (duplicate start times)
- **SECONDS_PACING_DOC**: Philosophy documentation printed to log once per run

### Changed
- **Version Header**: Updated to v4.7.1 with enhancement description
- **main() Initialization**: Now prints SECONDS_PACING_DOC and activates monkey-patches at start
- **Build Completion**: Runs run_marker_lints() before proj.Save() for validation

### Technical Details
- **100% Coverage**: All markers enriched (Masters + Principles + Segments + ShotFX + Selects)
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: v4.7 PACING_S system still used for masters
- **Transparent Integration**: Monkey-patching requires no changes to core create_* functions
- **Priority System**: TIER_OVERRIDES > LANE_NUANCE > DEFAULT_CUT_GUIDE for guidance lookup
- **Lint Output**: Human-readable warnings with timeline names, marker names, and specific issues
- **Lines Added**: ~275 lines (1610â€“1885) for complete enhancement system

## [v4.7] - 2025-10-08

### ðŸŽ¯ Philosophy Change: Seconds-Only Pacing
Complete rewrite of cut guidance system from beat-based to pure seconds-based approach.

### Added
- **PACING_S Dictionary**: 6 lanes Ã— 3 tiers Ã— section-specific seconds guidance
  - Money, MV, Fashion, Talking, DIL, Cook-Ups
  - 12s/22s/30s tiers for each lane
  - Unique ranges for HOOK, DRAW, COMMIT/PAYOFF, DEVELOP, LOOP/CTA, etc.
- **`_lane_tier_from_title()`**: Auto-detect lane and tier from timeline name
  - Explicit detection for Master timelines (e.g., "Money Master â€” 12s")
  - Inferred detection for principle timelines (e.g., "Segment â€” ..." â†’ "mv", "30s")
- **`_enrich_marker_notes()`**: Simplified enrichment using PACING_S lookup
  - Appends `â€” Cuts: <seconds guidance>` to marker notes
  - Cleaner, more actionable than v4.6's multi-line approach
- **`_butt_join_markers()`**: Seamless marker borders
  - Extends previous marker by â‰¤1 frame to close visual gaps
  - Creates continuous color bands in timeline UI
  - No overlap, no gaps

### Changed
- **Marker Enrichment**: Simplified from 3-tier system (_CUT_GUIDE_DEFAULT + _CUT_GUIDE_BY_LANE + _TIER_NUDGE) to single PACING_S lookup
- **Marker Borders**: Changed from "tight borders" (1-frame gap) to "butt-joined" (1-frame butt)
- **Tier System**: Removed "principle" and "selects" contexts; all non-masters default to "30s" tier with lane-specific guidance
- **Version Header**: Updated to v4.7 with new philosophy description

### Removed
- `_CUT_GUIDE_DEFAULT` dictionary (replaced by PACING_S)
- `_CUT_GUIDE_BY_LANE` dictionary (replaced by PACING_S)
- `_TIER_NUDGE` dictionary (replaced by PACING_S)
- `_role_normalize()` function (no longer needed)
- `_append_cut_note()` function (replaced by simpler _enrich_marker_notes)
- `_enrich_markers_with_cut_notes()` function (replaced by _enrich_marker_notes)
- `_tighten_marker_borders_if_enabled()` function (replaced by _butt_join_markers)
- `DEGA_MARKER_TIGHT_BORDERS` environment variable (no longer used)

### Technical Details
- **Backwards Incompatible**: v4.6 markers will work but won't have v4.7 guidance
- **Migration Path**: Use `DEGA_PRINCIPLE_FORCE_RESEED=1` to update existing projects
- **Call Sites Updated**: 4 locations where markers are enriched and borders adjusted
  - Principle timeline seeding (seed_principle_markers_across_project)
  - Money Master creation
  - Pillar principle timeline creation
  - Pillar Master Build timeline creation

---

## [v4.6] - 2025-10-07

### Added
- **Cut-Note Enrichment System**: Lane-specific and tier-specific edit pacing guidance
  - `_CUT_GUIDE_DEFAULT`: 11 role-based cut guides (HOOK, DRAW, PAYOFF, etc.)
  - `_CUT_GUIDE_BY_LANE`: 6 lane-specific nudges (Money, MV, Fashion, Talking, DIL, Cook-Ups)
  - `_TIER_NUDGE`: 5 context nudges (12s, 22s, 30s, principle, selects)
  - `_enrich_markers_with_cut_notes()`: Enrichment function combining all three
- **Tight Marker Borders**: Markers end 1 frame before next for gapless color bands
  - `_tighten_marker_borders_if_enabled()`: Reduces duration to create 1-frame visual gap
  - `DEGA_MARKER_TIGHT_BORDERS` environment variable (default ON)
- **Universal Application**: Applied to ALL timelines (Money Masters, pillar masters, principle timelines)
